<p><em>[This statement was submitted for publication by a GET-UP member who chooses to remain anonymous. We are grateful to her for allowing us to share her story.]</em></p>
<p>Toxic workplace cultures rampant with sexism and harassment have gained a lot of attention in the news lately, especially with the fallouts that have occurred at companies like Uber and Fox News. While I&#8217;m pleased to see that the public outcry about this is becoming more effective at enforcing some kind of justice in these situations, I also can’t help but notice that academic institutions are notably missing from this conversation, escaping blame and controversy by outwardly professing progressive ideals and giving the impression that academia is immune to these problems. Unfortunately that narrative stands in direct contrast with my personal experiences as a graduate student in an extremely hostile work environment here at Penn.</p>
<p>I have spent three years at Penn as a PhD student in SAS. The discipline I work in is a male dominated field, and having done undergraduate work and graduate work at other institutions within this same discipline, I thought when I came here that I was well prepared to handle the challenges of being a minority in this setting. My program was very small to begin with, and further narrowed down after the notorious prelim exams at the end of the first year, with me being only one of two female students in a class of about 20 to survive that process. In anticipation of these exams and of the collaborative research I hoped to conduct thereafter, I started to associate with a large group of my male classmates who tended to stick together. Things were alright at first, but in time commentary came up during discussions about the impending exams that to me had the clear intent of alienating me from the group. I was told by a male classmate that I would be given a passing grade on the exams because the program needed to retain me for diversity reasons; that, unlike my male classmates, I would likely receive unfair preferential treatment because I am a minority. Similar comments casting doubt on my abilities by dismissing my accomplishments as the result of minority favoritism were made when it was discovered that my funding came not from the department but from a graduate fellowship. At the time, my immediate instinct was to dismiss this commentary for a variety of reasons. First, I felt blindsided by the bold ignorance of the statements to the extent that I thought they had to have been sarcastic jokes. Secondly, these initial remarks were limited to one particular classmate, who I will henceforth refer to as John, and made in the context of a time when we were all very stressed about exams. So I took these jabs in stride and gave John the benefit of the doubt, and after the first year had ended and the dust from exams had settled, I interfaced even more with my male classmates. Part of that was out of necessity: I secured a research assistant position on the same project as John did and so we had to work together, and more broadly, research is by nature collaborative, so I felt it was important for me to &#8220;play nice&#8221;. More than those reasons, however, I really wanted to have an intellectual community to belong to, and I also sincerely thought that my presence and collaboration with my colleagues would demonstrate to them that any biases against me they might have had were unfounded. After all, we are scientists, and evidence is the most effective way to confront a faulty hypothesis. </p>
<p>It was not long, however, before I was forced to confront the very painful realization that bias is far from scientific. In attempting to engage more, I soon found myself dogged by escalated remarks from all sides, e.g., John’s unqualified offer of advice that I should &#8220;be casual and hook up with guys&#8221; and &#8220;be polyamorous&#8221; among other unsolicited sexual remarks, or the intrusive inquiries from other classmates about whether I had a profile on a popular dating app and the comment that if I did, I &#8220;could be considered a whore&#8221;. In working as a research assistant with John I not only dealt with regular verbal harassment like this, but also intimidation and unauthorized interference with my work. For instance, John was very concerned that I would communicate with our professor too assertively and that this would reflect poorly on his reputation with our professor, so he demanded to read and edit my emails to the professor about the project before I sent them. On one occasion when I disobeyed John by contacting the professor without going through him, he became so furious that upon encountering me in person, John physically cornered me, not allowing me to open a door until I would engage with him in the argument. On another occasion, I became frustrated that, despite promises to pay us, our professor had still failed to compensate us well after the project had ended, so I wanted to contact the professor to prompt him for our compensation. John was extremely opposed to this idea, but allowed me to do so after he edited the email to our professor. In response, our professor told us to provide him with an estimate of the number of hours we worked and the hourly rate we had been paid for other projects. John proposed that we provide him with a very minimal estimate and a rate significantly lower than the standard rate, because he thought this would maintain a good rapport with our professor. After a heated argument, I ended up requesting the fair amount of compensation from our professor, while John insisted on taking a smaller share in accordance with his reputational concerns. </p>
<p>These incidents by themselves are more than sufficient to establish that I endured sexual harassment by my colleagues, as well as abusive behavior that threatened my emotional well being and aspects of my professional welfare. (Needless to say I relied heavily on outside mental health resources during this time at my own expense because CAPS had told me they were overbooked.) The next natural step for me to take was to notify authority figures to see if they could interfere in some way. While I strongly considered this option, I ultimately decided against it, because I had strong evidence that these problems would not only be overlooked by authorities in my department, but that this culture was encouraged by some professors there. By the time I was ready to act against the harassment I encountered, I had already heard one of my male professors threaten to slap a female classmate for suggesting a hypothesis that he deemed to be a feminist myth, and another make a joke about needing a one child policy for the few female professors in our department. I had already felt utterly tokenized in having been selected to serve on the graduate program’s social committee with John, without any transparency from my program’s administration about how I had been chosen for this role, and then subsequently told by my classmates that I was selected because of my gender, how I look, and how “cool” I am. I had already tried in this role, in spite of it all, to reform aspects of the program by promoting counseling and mentoring efforts, and by attempting to reach out to other minority students, but through John’s controlling participation, had been ultimately relegated to the planning of happy hours and the promotion of an idealized advertisement of our program that bore little resemblance to my experience there. The cumulative impact, then, of all these additional contextual experiences, was to deter me from acting at all.</p>
<p>So in the end, I did what so many other women and minorities in this difficult position have done: I left. I am no longer a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. In a fitting conclusion to this experience, and further reinforcement of my decision, the graduate director for my program did not prompt me for my reasons for quitting when I notified him of my decision to leave. It’s abundantly clear that this was the only way I could affect my situation as an individual. And I don’t regret that. I realize now that a large part of what was keeping me there was a misplaced sense of responsibility to correct and disprove the biases against me, and having relinquished that burden I feel incredibly free. But I also know that while this was the optimal choice for me given what I was able to control, it is not the optimal outcome for my profession, and for scientific progress in general. Progress is not progress at all if it comes at the expense of others, or is exclusionary of diverse backgrounds, and I do not want to see other women forced to make the same choice I made. My experience has been a testament to what little power we have as individuals to affect the larger culture we work in, but that also speaks to what great power we might attain if we stand together. This is why I have come to support graduate student unionization at Penn, and am proud to support the efforts of GET-UP to make this possible. Unionization is by no means a panacea for the hostile institutional culture, but it can help ensure that formal processes are put in place and enforced to increase institutional accountability for these problems, and I firmly believe it would have given me a voice in a situation where I had none. While I will no longer benefit from the unionization effort, it can give a voice to the countless women and minorities who still stand to benefit from this advocacy as graduate students at Penn, and I hope that you, their friends, their classmates, and their peers will stand with them to create cultural change by supporting GET-UP.</p>
<p>On a final note, I will mention that I was informed by fellow union members that John, my former classmate, is unsurprisingly strongly opposed to unionization. When approached by GET-UP members, he vehemently argued with them about the possibility of strikes, and the damage unionization could do to his reputation with professors. But most importantly, he insisted that &#8220;no one wants Penn to unionize, speaking for all the graduate students in our department&#8221;.</p>
<p>I may no longer be a graduate student at Penn, but, in case it isn’t already clear from my previous statements, John does not speak for me. He never has, and he never will. Will you let him speak for you?</p>
